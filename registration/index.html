            <p>Requests to cancel the registration must be addressed directly to the General Chair, strictly before 14/06/2024 (the early bird deadline). Requests received before the early bird deadline will receive a refund of the 25% of the registration fee, minus any transaction/processing fees. It will not be possible to refund (totally or partially) registrations once the early bird deadline has passed (said otherwise, refund requests received by the General Chair from the the 14/06/2024 will not be considered).</p>
