                                ACM provides a template for Microsoft Word and a template for LaTeX.
                                However, ACM is currently in the process of revamping its Word template.
                                <strong>We highly recommend using the LaTeX template.</strong>

                                aware of the mandatory sections, copyright strip information (see next
                                step), formatting requirements, font requirements, font sizes, and spacing

                                The correct ACM DEBS 2024 copyright-permission notice needs to be inserted
                                in the template, see page 1, bottom of column 1 before you submit your final
                                version. The ACM rights management process will email the lead author this
                                information when the online ACM copyright form is completed. There are three
                                different forms of copyright block. ACM rights management system will
                                automatically send you the correct copyright text based on the form you
                                choose. A custom DOI URL will also be included in that email.

                                <strong>Note:</strong> the main problem that occurs with submissions
                                generated with pdflatex is that the fonts are not embedded properly. This
                                most often occurs because vector images included from your LaTeX do not
                                themselves embed their fonts. If we find problems with your PDF, and you are
                                unable to submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may
                                have to take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a
                                PostScript (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.

                                template and publishes new versions. If you submit a paper using an outdated
                                version of the template, you might be required to update to a newer version.

                                to ensure that the tones and screens used in your images or figures
                                reproduce well in black and white, too. However, your images will appear in
                                full color in any distributed electronic proceedings and in the ACM digital

                                <strong>Resolution &amp; CMYK.</strong> Figures, charts, and diagrams should
                                use a vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images (e.g. photographs)
                                should be at least 300 or 600 dpi for quality reproduction and saved as
                                .tiff images (or other compatible formats that support print-quality
                                resolution). When creating or revising your images for inclusion in the
                                paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as the color profile.

                                <strong>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) image.</strong> For raster images (e.g.
                                photos), TIFFs are preferred for press applications where quality takes
                                priority over file size. When TIFFs are compressed (using LZW compression
                                option when saving from Adobe Photoshop, for example), no image data is
                                lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a compressed image format
                                designed to keep the file size small, which makes it ideal for use in web
                                graphics. However, to achieve this, the JPEG format actually removes
                                precision from the image. This is referred to as a lossy compression system.
                                On a printout, the removed data tends to show up as blocky areas of a solid
                                color, or ghosting near high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions
                                (a minimum of 200 dpi), there’s usually enough data in the JPEG file for the
                                compression artefacts to be very noticeable.

                                <strong>Rules/Lines.</strong> Rules used in your graphs, tables or charts
                                must be at least 0.5 point in stroke and black for quality reproduction.
                                Finer lines and points than this will not reproduce well, even if you can
                                see them on your laser printed hardcopy when checked — your laser printers
                                will usually have a far lower resolution than the imagesetters that will be
                                used.
