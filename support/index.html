              <h1>Support DEBS 2024</h1><br>
              <h4>We would like to invite you to sponsor the 18th edition of the ACM International Conference on
                Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS)!</h4>

              <p>DEBS is an annual technical conference with the objectives of providing a forum
                dedicated to the dissemination of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the
                reporting of experiences relevant to event-based computing. It is sponsored by ACM, the world leading
                organization for ICT professionals. Sponsorship by ACM is a token of quality of the conference. Less
                than 5% of larger international conferences on informatics receive ACM sponsorship.</p>

              <p>Distributed event-based systems serve as an enabling technology for many important
                application areas such as AI/ML, IoT, Blockchain, big data processing, stream processing and CEP, social
                networking, green computing and enterprise application integration, as well as societal challenges
                including Smart Urban Transport, Smart Energy Networks, eHealth systems, etc. In particular the
                pre-conference tutorial day and Industrial and Experience Report track of the conference should be of
                high relevance for industry and public agencies.</p>

              <p>By becoming a DEBS contributor, you will have the great opportunity to display your
                company and products at a major forum dedicated to event-based computing. DEBS is an established forum
                to bridge academia with industry. At DEBS, you will get in touch with the best international students in
                the field who might become your future customers or staff.</p>

              <p>With your sponsorship, you will help us in keeping registration fees low while
                providing an excellent program, hence convincing even more attendees to join DEBS. Moreover, sponsorship
                entitles you to promote your company at the conference through logo placements and info material in
                various conference handouts, depending on sponsorship level (TBA).</p>
