  title: Putting the S back into IoT - Tutorial on Sensor and Actor Systems in Small Portable Ad-Hoc Networks

  anchor: tutorial1
  abstract:  This tutorial introduces participants to the fundamentals and advanced concepts of integrating sensor and actor systems within the Internet of Things (IoT) through hands-on experience with small, portable ad-hoc networks. We will learn to create and manage our own IoT networks by utilizing several ESP32 and ESP8266-based devices connected to various actors and sensors alongside easily configurable IoT edge network set-ups. Using Node-RED for data flow and event-based integration, we will orchestrate the systems. Simple dashboard and database connectivity options in Node-RED will help us build IoT applications and workflows without the complexity of traditional programming environments.

  title: Durable Execution with Restate

  abstract:  Developing applications in a microservice architecture is hard. For all the benefits that it brings over monolithic application architectures, they expose developers to all sorts of tough distributed systems problems, making it non-trivial to build applications that are consistent, scalable, and resilient. In this session, we explain what Durable Execution is and how it solves these issues. We share ideas from Restate, a Durable Execution Engine that manages crucial aspects like reliable messaging, durable timers, fail-over and consistent state. Restate implements low-latency durable execution with a partitioned command log. The runtime pushes invocations to services and functions, journals the execution, and handles retries and fail-over. In this tutorial, we'll implement an event-driven application with Restate to give you a practical understanding of Durable Execution and how it works.

  title: "NebulaStream: Data Management for the Internet of Things"
  affiliation: TU Berlin

  anchor: tutorial3
  abstract:  Soon, there will be more data produced outside the cloud than inside. This requires new systems that can holistically optimize the processing for so-called sensor-fog-cloud environments. In this tutorial, we present NebulaStream, the first system designed for this environment. We will highlight research challenges, outline system internals, and provide hands-on experiences to the attendees to enable future researches to use NebulaStream as a framework to  try out their own ideas and benefit from its unique features.
