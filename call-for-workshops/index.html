                                The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems (DEBS) is soliciting proposals for affiliated workshops. The purpose of the workshops is to provide a forum for exchanging opinions, presenting ideas, and discussing preliminary results in an interactive atmosphere.
                            </p>

                            <p>
