                                The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems
                                (DEBS) is a premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of
                                event-based computing related to Big Data, AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems in
                                general. DEBS 2024 will be a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original research,
                                the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to
                                distributed and event‐based systems.

                                DEBS {{site.data.dates.conference_year}} will have two submission cycles for the research track. There will be a
                                rebuttal phase for both submission cycles. We provide the possibility for papers
                                that are considered promising but not ready to offer one-shot revisions between the
                                Fall and Spring deadlines. More information is provided below.

                            <p>The DEBS 2024 research track welcomes papers in the following
                                categories:</p>

                            <li>
                                Regular and short papers, presenting original research results on the topics of
                                DEBS as well as experimental papers that provide new insights into the behavior
                                of existing algorithms and systems. Authors should state their submission type
                                (regular/short) in the title.
                                Notice that authors that submit a paper as regular might be offered the
                                opportunity of having their work published as a short paper.
                                Page limits: 12 pages for regular papers (including references) and 6 pages for
                                short papers (including references).

                                Vision papers, outlining futuristic distributed and event-based systems.
                                Submissions should describe novel early-stage projects with eventually high
                                impact. Each submission should clearly state the success criteria of the
                                futuristic system. Page limit: 6 pages (all-inclusive).

                            <p>DEBS {{site.data.dates.conference_year}} places emphasis on <b>reproducibility</b>: we encourage
                                authors of Research papers and Experiments & Benchmarks papers to make available all
                                data used for empirical evaluation, the related software as well as clear
                                instructions for reproducing the presented experiments, as a form of supplementary
                                material. The reviewers will be encouraged to consider this material. This year's
                                edition will place ACM Artifacts Available badges on papers that make their
                                artifacts available according to ACM's rules (please see <a

                                Authors of selected, top-rated papers from DEBS 2024 may be invited to submit an

                                The conference adopts a double-blind review process for the research track, where
                                neither authors nor reviewers know each other’s identities. This means that papers
                                or any other material must not list or otherwise identify the authors. References to
                                previous work should be done in the third person so as to not reveal the identities
                                of the authors. Submissions that are not anonymous may be rejected without review.
                            </p>

                                Submissions to the research track will be evaluated by the Research Program
                                Committee. The authors of accepted papers will be given a choice between different
                                copyright agreements, according to ACM policies. The options will include
                                opportunities for open access as well as the traditional ACM copyright agreement.

                                DEBS 2024 adopts a dual-deadline model, with a submission deadline in the Fall and
                                another one in the Spring.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Authors of papers receiving a Reject decision for the Fall deadline are not allowed to
                                resubmit to the Spring deadline for DEBS 2024. There are, however, no constraints for a
                                resubmission to a future edition of DEBS.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In specific cases, the program committee may decide to offer a one-shot revision
                                decision for authors of papers submitted to the Fall deadline, that would be considered
                                promising but lacking in presentation or clarity. In this case, authors will have the
                                possibility to send an updated version to the Spring deadline for reevaluation.
                            </p>
