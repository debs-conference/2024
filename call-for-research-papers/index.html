                                The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) is a premier 
                                venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of distributed and event-based 
                                computing and data processing. DEBS 2024 will be a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original 
                                research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant 
                                to distributed and event‐based systems.

                                on the nature of their contribution. All submissions will undergo an extensive peer review process.

                                The DEBS conference covers topics in distributed and event-based computing for a wide range of 
                                application domains and computing environments. The conference aims to present novel solutions 
                                for collecting, detecting, processing, analyzing, and responding to events through distributed 
                                middleware, systems, and platforms.

                            <p>DEBS 2024 places emphasis on reproducibility: We encourage authors of research papers and 
                                experiments and benchmarks papers to make all supplementary material available: data used 
                                for empirical evaluation, the related software, as well as clear instructions for reproducing 
                                the presented experiments. The reviewers will be encouraged to consider this material. 
                                This year's edition will place ACM Artifacts Available badges on papers that make their

                                or go through a one month shepherded revision phase, giving papers which require minor

                                DEBS 2024 adopts a dual-deadline model, with a submission deadline in the Fall and
                                another one in the Spring.
                            </p>

                                Authors of papers receiving a Reject decision for the Fall deadline are not allowed to
                                resubmit to the Spring deadline for DEBS 2024. There are, however, no constraints for a
                                resubmission to a future edition of DEBS.

                                In specific cases, the program committee may decide to offer a one-shot revision
                                decision for authors of papers submitted to the Fall deadline, that would be considered
                                promising but lacking in presentation or clarity. In this case, authors will have the
                                possibility to send an updated version to the Spring deadline for reevaluation.
